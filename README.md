# Lain-kde-splash

A splash screen for KDE plasma.

**Note:**

**This is a fork. Original version can be found from [bouteillerAlan](https://github.com/bouteillerAlan/kuro).

## Differences

Almost no. I just replace Kuro with Lain.

## Installation

Clone and place it into `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel/`.
